<h3>Here are a few things that I have been doing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Scaled the platform to <strong>2.5M+ users</strong>, ensuring <strong>high availability</strong>, <strong>performance</strong>, and <strong>reliability</strong>.</li>
  <li>Built and scaled an <strong>automated lead distribution system</strong>, efficiently managing <strong>1M+ leads daily</strong>.</li>
  <li>Led a team of <strong>2 interns</strong> to build an <strong>AI-driven analytical dashboard</strong> with chat-based insights and intuitive data visualizations.</li>
  <li>Optimized <strong>SEO and performance</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Boosted Google visibility.</li>
      <li>Improved load time by <strong>80%</strong>.</li>
      <li>Increased Lighthouse score to <strong>85+</strong>.</li>
      <li>Reduced API response time to <strong>&lt; 200ms</strong>.</li>
      <li>Migrated key pages to <strong>Next.js</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Implemented <strong>path-tracking middleware</strong> to log API call journeys from request to response, <strong>reducing debugging time by 90%</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Killed Projects</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>IdeaBook</strong> – A distraction-free note-taking app to capture and organize startup ideas. Shut down due to low user engagement and lack of product-market fit.</li>
  <li><strong>Fibo</strong> – A fitness CRM for gyms and online fitness businesses. After interviewing 30 users, discovered limited demand — only 2 users showed genuine interest, so it was discontinued.</li>
</ul>
